A profiler  is a tool for monitoring the dynamic execution behaviour of a program.
A profiler   measures the memory usage, execution time and typical instructions during the
execution of a program.

A profiler provides insight in the execution behaviour of a program for debugging
purposes, This analysis is also used to improve the performance or decreasing the
memory footprint of an application.

Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP, [43]) is a programming paradigm that adds additional
behaviour to source code without the need to modify the original code.
