I wanted to do:

a function to only work when arguments are numbers

Trouble creating a function that prints to n (n is an Integer)

Had to Disect the match
Had to consider the type when using parttern matching for extracting
Know what you dealing with

date_time = { {year, month, day}, _ } = :calendar.local_time()

here had to know that :calendar.local_time() result is a tuple then made it easy
to know how to extract the values you want 

date_time = {date,_} = { {year, month, day}, _ } = :calendar.local_time()

why cant we do this 
cond do
	keywordlist[:name] = "Thabo" -> "Hola #{keywordlist[:name]}"
end

understand the difference between an expression, value, pattern, term
