Elixir notes for the Beginner.

We use computers everyday, on this computers are applications which enable us to utilize the computer
this applications are actually instructions which are given to the computer as BITS, 
though the computer can understand bits, humans have devised a way to provide this instructions
to the computer using what are called Programming Languages, so basically programming languages are languages
which people use to instruct the computer.

"An example of a computer instruction given to the computer, can be : When a user presses enter, send the email :) "

and because the computer is versatile, it has now been moulded into what we today term "The Cloud"
or perhaps that teller machine they use at your local store and even the machine handling thousands of 
records at that busy airport, there had to be various ways which we could instruct 
the computer in those scenarios thus various Programming Languages for doing various tasks.

This programming languages are classified in paradigms based on their features,
the most frequently used paradigms are Procedural and Functional paradigms, thus the prevalence of Procedural and Functional Programming Languages,
a layman's  identification of the distinction between the two would be that with Procedural programming languages, 
the instructions are given to the computer as a set of procedures which can change a value at a certain memory location,
whereas with Functional programming languages, the instructions are given as a set of mathematical functions
which are provided with data that the functions manipulate.

another appealing difference is that procedural languages share memory therefore they can change state, meaning 
that if a certain memory location on the computer RAM, Register, or what's hot this days, contains the bits 100110 (data)
which is an 8, this languages can instruct the computer to change it to a 9 (0011011) but with functional languages once 
a certain memory location contains the value 10, that location will have that value until the instruction is complete
or the memory location is regarded as free, if there are no instructions which use the value at that location.

Elixir is a functional programming language, this languages use immutable data and use functions to transform the data. 
Elixir has been designed to run on the Erlang Virtual Machine, which makes it easy to integrate with the "Erlang programming language"

The Erlang Virtual Machine / Beam is capable of running Concurrent, fault tolerant, Highly Scalable 
systems with little or no downtime.

A concurrent program is a program that can be run on a multi-core computer,
this programs are written with a concurrent programming language

A concurrent programming language is a language which has explicit constructs for writing
multi core based programs,this languages have special constructs for expressing
concurrency in the language itself. 

Having written a concurrent program, we can run it on a parallel computer.
a parallel computer is a computer which has more than one CPU running at the same time.
A concurrent program can also be run on a set of networked computers or
in the cloud.

Sequential languages are languages that were designed for writing sequential
programs and have no linguistic constructs for describing concurrent computations.
